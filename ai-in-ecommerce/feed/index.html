<h2>1. What is British AI and How It is Changing the Future</h2>
<p>British AI refers to the development and application of artificial intelligence within the United Kingdom. From healthcare to finance, AI in Britain is not just an emergent technology; it&#8217;s a catalyst for redefining leadership and innovation in our rapidly advancing world (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2023/07/03/how-ai-is-transforming-the-leadership-landscape-in-the-21st-century/" target="_new" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>).</p>
<p>The power of British AI and how it is transforming the world is outlined below:</p>
